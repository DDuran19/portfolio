# 💻 Freelance Developer  
## Upwork – Vendor Interaction Platform (SvelteKit Project)

## 🛠️ Project Ownership & Tech Stack

Originally hired for basic collaboration and tutoring, I quickly transitioned into a **core engineering role**, where I was trusted to **design and implement the entire platform** structure and logic. The app was built entirely by me using a clean, scalable, and secure architecture:

- 🧱 **Built from scratch** using **SvelteKit** with the **Repository-Service Pattern**
- ☁️ **Cloudflare Developer Stack**:
  - **Pages** for front-end hosting
  - **D1** for relational database management
  - **R2** for object storage
  - **Cloudflare Images** for asset hosting and optimization
- 🔌 **Third-Party Integrations**:
  - **Maps API** (vendor locations and geofilters)
  - **Stripe API** (franchise/subscription payments)
  - **Shopify API** and **Commerce7 API** (product/inventory sync)

The result is a fully functional multi-vendor ecosystem, optimized for performance, scalability, and business extensibility.

## 📈 Performance-Based Growth

This role began with a modest entry-level rate of **$4.00/hr**. Due to consistently high-quality output, problem-solving, and self-management, I received **automated 15% rate increases every 3 months**, growing to **$8.04/hr** within a year:

- **Apr 2024:** $4.00/hr  
- **Jul 2024:** $4.60/hr

- **Jan 2025:** $6.08/hr  
- **Apr 2025:** $6.99/hr

Each increase was granted without request — a direct reflection of trust and performance.
